======

LsQ Bot (short for Elle's Queue Bot) is a [queueing](https://xkcd.com/853/) bot designed to allow players in a Twitch chat to challenge one another. It was designed specifically for Tetris Deathmatch, but it's open source and thus available to whomever wishes to use (or tweak) it. It is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
